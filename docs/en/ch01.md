# 1.â€‚Scope

This specification document defines the structure and interpretation of programs in the P416 language. It defines the syntax, semantic rules, and requirements for conformant implementations of the language.

It does not define:

- Mechanisms by which P4 programs are compiled, loaded, and executed on packet-processing systems,
- Mechanisms by which data are received by one packet-processing system and delivered to another system,
- Mechanisms by which the control plane manages the match-action tables and other stateful objects defined by P4 programs,
- The size or complexity of P4 programs,
- The minimal requirements of packet-processing systems that are capable of providing a conformant implementation.

It is understood that some implementations may be unable to implement the behavior defined here in all cases, or may provide options to eliminate some safety guarantees in exchange for better performance or handling larger programs. They should document where they deviate from this specification.
