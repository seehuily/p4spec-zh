# 2. Terms, definitions, and symbols

Throughout this document, the following terms will be used:

- Architecture: A set of P4-programmable components and the data plane interfaces between them.
- Control plane: A class of algorithms and the corresponding input and output data that are concerned with the provisioning and configuration of the data plane.
- Data plane: A class of algorithms that describe transformations on packets by packet-processing systems.
- Metadata: Intermediate data generated during execution of a P4 program.
- Packet: A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.
- Packet header: Formatted data at the beginning of a packet. A given packet may contain a sequence of packet headers representing different network protocols.
- Packet payload: Packet data that follows the packet headers.
- Packet-processing system: A data-processing system designed for processing network packets. In general, packet-processing systems implement control plane and data plane algorithms.
- Target: A packet-processing system capable of executing a P4 program.

All terms defined explicitly in this document should not be understood to refer implicitly to similar terms defined elsewhere. Conversely, any terms not defined explicitly in this document should be interpreted according to generally recognizable sources—e.g., IETF RFCs.
